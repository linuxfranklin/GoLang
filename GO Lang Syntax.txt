Types and Description

Boolean types
They are boolean types and consists of the two predefined constants: (a) true (b) false

Numeric types
They are again arithmetic types and they represents a) integer types or b) floating point values throughout the program.

String types
A string type represents the set of string values. Its value is a sequence of bytes. Strings are immutable types that is once created, it is not possible to change the contents of a string. The predeclared string type is string.

Derived types
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and (e) Function types f) Slice types g) Interface types h) Map types i) Channel Types



INTEGERS
------------
uint8 - 	Unsigned 8-bit integers (0 to 255)
uint16 -	Unsigned 16-bit integers (0 to 65535)
uint32 -	Unsigned 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
uint64 -	Unsigned 64-bit integers (0 to 18446744073709551615)
int8 -		Signed 8-bit integers (-128 to 127)
int16 -		Signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)
int32 -		Signed 32-bit integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
int64 -		Signed 64-bit integers (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)

Floating Types
---------------
float32-	IEEE-754 32-bit floating-point numbers
float64 -	IEEE-754 64-bit floating-point numbers
complex64 -	Complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
complex128 -	Complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts


Other Numeric Types
-------------------
byte -		same as uint8
rune -		same as int32
uint -		32 or 64 bits
int  -		same size as uint
uintptr -	an unsigned integer to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value
